    "This practical continues where the previous one left off. You will continue to investigate baseband communications between a transmitter and a receiver. However, in this practical, you will study the effect of noise on the reliability of data transmission. You will experimentally measure the increase in bit error probability as the noise in the channel increases, and compare it to the theoretically predicted value.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will first create a simple transmitter and receiver to transmit the message \"Hello, world!\" encoded as a polar baseband signalling scheme. We will connect two computers using stereo audio cable (which has a left and right channel). The simple transmitter will initially transmit the line coded signal on the left channel, while a clock signal is transmitted on the right channel. The receiver will use the clock signal to decode polar line coded signal and retrieve the original message. We will then modify the receiver to extract the clock signal by self-synchronising on the line coded signal (i.e. just using the left-channel information).\n",
    "\n",
    "After successfully transmitting and receiving the short message, we will modify the transmitter and receiver to transmit 100,000 bits of information. We will again initially use the clock signal sent on the right channel to decode the received signal. After successful decoding of the 100,000 bits, we will again modify the receiver to extract the clock signal by self-synchronisation.\n",

    "1. Separately measure the signal strength and noise strength at the receiver. Note that, in a practical receiver, the signal is usually so much stronger than the noise, that you can disregard the noise power when measuring the signal power. To measure the noise power, you switch off the signal (i.e. you can measure the noise power in the silence before and after the polar signal occurs in the recorded data). \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Transmit packets of 100,000 bits at different signal-to-noise ratios ($\\sigma$ = 0.10A to 0.50A should be reasonable), and measure the average bit error probability. Plot it, and compare it to the theoretically predicted values for polar signalling. \n",
    "\n",
    "Take note the following:\n",
    "1. For polar signalling the probability of error is given by\n",
    "    $P_{b} = Q\\left(\\frac{A_p}{\\sigma}\\right)$ where $A_p$ is the amplitude of the received pulse (after normalisation) and $\\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the noise (after normalisation). \n",

    "    ~~~python\n",
    "    stats.norm.sf(x)\n",
    "    ~~~\n",
    "3. The standard deviation of the noise can be measured by measure the noise power $N_i$ and noting that $N_i = \\sigma^2$\n",
    "4. For polar signalling the received amplitude can be estimated by one of two methods:\n",
    "    1. Estimating the mean amplitude by measuring the amplitude at all the sampling instants.\n",
